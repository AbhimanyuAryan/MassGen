  "reason": "This agent provides the most comprehensive and well-structured answer. It not only correctly identifies Paris as the primary capital but also gives a detailed breakdown of why, including its longevity and cultural significance. Furthermore, it lists other historical capitals with important context, such as explaining why Versailles was a de facto capital and why Vichy, while a capital, was certainly not 'loved'. This level of detail and historical nuance makes it the superior response.",
