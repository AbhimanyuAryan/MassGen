Historically, while France has had temporary shifts in governmental seats during times of crisis (e.g., Bordeaux during wars, Vichy during WWII), Paris has consistently been the most recognized and loved capital by the French people. It has served as the capital for the vast majority of France's history, becoming the center of royal power, culture, and governance from the early Middle Ages. Paris is deeply intertwined with French national identity, art, literature, and political history, making it the most enduring and cherished capital.
