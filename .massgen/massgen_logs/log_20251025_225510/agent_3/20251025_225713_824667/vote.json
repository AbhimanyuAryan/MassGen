  "reason": "Agent 6 provides the most comprehensive and well-structured answer. It clearly identifies Paris as the most recognized and loved capital, and then effectively contextualizes this by detailing its longevity and significance, while also listing and briefly explaining other historical temporary capitals (Versailles, Tours/Bourges, Vichy). This directly addresses the user's premise about France having changed its capital multiple times, providing a complete and nuanced historical perspective.",
