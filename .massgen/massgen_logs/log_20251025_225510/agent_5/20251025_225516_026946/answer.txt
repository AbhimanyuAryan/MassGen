While France has indeed had various temporary or de facto capitals throughout its history, particularly during times of war or political upheaval (such as Versailles during the monarchy, or Bordeaux and Vichy during World War I and II respectively), Paris stands out as the most consistently recognized and deeply loved capital by the French people historically. Paris has been the seat of power, culture, and national identity for centuries, far eclipsing any other city in its historical significance and affection among the French.
