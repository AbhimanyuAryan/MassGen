While France has had several cities serve as its capital or seat of government throughout its long history, **Paris** is unequivocally the most popular and significant capital.

Here's why Paris stands out, followed by a look at other notable historical capitals:

### The Most Popular Capital: Paris

Paris's popularity stems from its enduring role as the heart of the nation for over a millennium.

*   **Longevity and Consistency:** Paris has been the official capital for most of France's history, since 987 AD when Hugh Capet made it the center of his power. With only a few brief interruptions during times of war, it has held this title continuously.
*   **Central Hub of Power:** It has consistently been the undisputed political, economic, cultural, and intellectual center of the nation. Major historical events that shaped France and the world, from the French Revolution to the May 68 protests, have been centered in Paris.
*   **Global Recognition and Cultural Influence:** Internationally, Paris is one of the most famous and visited cities in the world. It is synonymous with French culture, art, fashion, gastronomy, and philosophy, making it the most "popular" capital in every sense of the word. Its iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and Notre-Dame Cathedral are globally recognized symbols of France.

### Other Notable Historical Capitals & Seats of Government

Your question correctly notes that France has had other capitals in the past. These were often temporary or served a specific purpose:

*   **Versailles:** While Paris remained the official capital, the Palace of Versailles was the *de facto* center of royal power and the seat of government for over a century (1682–1789) under monarchs like Louis XIV. Today, it is an immensely popular historical site and a UNESCO World Heritage site.
*   **Vichy:** This city served as the capital of the collaborationist French State ("Vichy France") during World War II from 1940 to 1944, while Paris was under German occupation.
*   **Temporary Capitals in Times of Crisis:** During wars and invasions when Paris was threatened, the government temporarily relocated to other cities. The most notable examples include:
    *   **Bordeaux:** Served as a temporary capital during the Franco-Prussian War (1870) and at the beginning of both World War I (1914) and World War II (1940).
    *   **Tours** and **Bourges:** Acted as capitals at different points during the Hundred Years' War in the 15th century.

In conclusion, while other cities have played the crucial role of capital at pivotal moments, none possess the historical weight, continuous influence, or popular acclaim of Paris, which remains the true and enduring heart of France.
