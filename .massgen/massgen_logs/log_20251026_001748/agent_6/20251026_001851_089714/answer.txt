While France has had several cities serve as its capital or seat of government throughout its long history, **Paris** is unequivocally the most popular and significant capital.

Here's why:

*   **Longevity and Consistency:** Paris has been the official capital of France for most of the nation's history, since 987 AD when Hugh Capet made it the center of his power. With only a few brief interruptions during times of war or political upheaval, it has held this title for over a millennium.
*   **Central Hub of Power:** It has consistently been the undisputed political, economic, cultural, and intellectual heart of the nation. Major historical events, from the French Revolution to the May 68 protests, have centered around Paris.
*   **Global Recognition:** Internationally, Paris is one of the most famous and visited cities in the world. It is synonymous with French culture, art, fashion, and gastronomy, making it the most "popular" capital in the modern sense of the word.

**Other notable historical capitals or seats of government include:**

*   **Versailles:** While Paris remained the official capital, the Palace of Versailles was the de facto center of royal power and the seat of government for over a century under monarchs like Louis XIV, Louis XV, and Louis XVI (from 1682 until 1789).
*   **Vichy:** This city served as the capital of the collaborationist French State ("Vichy France") during World War II from 1940 to 1944.
*   **Temporary Capitals:** In times of crisis, the government has temporarily relocated. For example:
    *   **Tours** and **Bourges** served as capitals during the Hundred Years' War.
    *   **Bordeaux** became the temporary seat of government during the Franco-Prussian War (1870) and at the beginning of both World War I (1914) and World War II (1940).

In conclusion, while other cities have played the role of capital at crucial moments, none have the historical weight, duration, or popular acclaim of Paris.
