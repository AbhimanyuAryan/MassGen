France has indeed had several historical capitals, but without a doubt, **Paris** is the most popular and historically significant.Paris has served as the capital of France for the vast majority of its history, particularly since the early Middle Ages. Its prominence grew significantly with the Capetian dynasty, and it became the undisputed center of political, economic, and cultural life. While other cities like Tours (during the Hundred Years' War) or Bordeaux (briefly during World War I and II) served as temporary seats of government, none have held the continuous importance and global recognition that Paris enjoys.Its popularity stems from its long-standing role as the seat of power, its iconic landmarks, its status as a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and its immense historical impact on both France and the world.
