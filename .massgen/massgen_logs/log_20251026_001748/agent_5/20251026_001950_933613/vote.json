  "reason": "Agent 6 provides the most comprehensive and well-structured answer. It correctly identifies Paris as the most popular and significant capital, offering strong reasons like longevity, central hub of power, and global recognition. Crucially, it also provides excellent context on other historical capitals and seats of government (like Versailles, Vichy, Tours, Bordeaux), clarifying their roles and durations, which adds significant value and addresses potential nuances in the question.",
