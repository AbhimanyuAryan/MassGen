While Paris has been the capital of France for most of its history, the most popular and famous former capital is undoubtedly **Versailles**.

Here's why:

**1. Historical Significance:**
From 1682 until the French Revolution in 1789, King Louis XIV moved the royal court and the entire government of France from Paris to the Palace of Versailles. This made it the de facto political capital of the kingdom for over a century, during the height of France's power in Europe. All major political decisions were made there.

**2. Modern Popularity:**
The Palace of Versailles is one of the most famous buildings in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is an extremely popular tourist destination, attracting millions of visitors each year who come to see the opulent Hall of Mirrors, the vast Gardens of Versailles, and the royal apartments.

**Other Notable Former Capitals:**

While Versailles is the most famous, other cities have served as the capital at different points in history:

*   **Vichy:** The capital of the French State ("Vichy France") during World War II (1940-1944).
*   **Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle):** Located in modern-day Germany, it was the capital of the Carolingian Empire under Charlemagne, which included the territory of France.
*   **Tours, Bordeaux, and Clermont-Ferrand:** These cities served as temporary capitals for brief periods, usually during times of war or invasion when Paris was threatened.
